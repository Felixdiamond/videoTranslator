## VideoTranslator

My trial to create an open source video translator since i couldn't find any :( .
I made sure to use services available for free to make it accessible to everyone.

Right now i have a basic script that works yeah, but needs improvement on the playback speed

Stay tuned (✿◡‿◡)

If you have any ideas to further improve the synchronisation between the video and splitted audio, feel free to contribute or contact me.

## Usage

To use the video translator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Felixdiamond/videoTranslator.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd videoTranslator
    ```

4. Run the translator script:
    ```
    python translator.py <video_path> <target_language>
    ```

5. Wait for the translation process to complete. The translated video will be saved in the same directory as the original video.
