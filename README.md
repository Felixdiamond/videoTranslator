## VideoTranslator

My trial to create an open source video translator since i couldn't find any :( .
I made sure to use services available for free to make it accessible to everyone.

Right now i just have the basic script that has problems syncing translated audio with video 🥲 but i'll finish it up and create a frontend for easy usage. All you can run locally on your pc without much resources.

Stay tuned (✿◡‿◡)

Oh and if you have any ideas to further improve the synchronisation between the video and splitted audio, feel free to contribute or contact me.
