# VideoTranslator ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪

## Welcome to my open-source video translation adventure! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

I got tired of waiting for someone else to make a cool open-source video translator, so I decided to create one myself! This project aims to make video translation accessible to everyone by using free services. It's still a work in progress, but hey, Rome wasn't built in a day, right? (￣ω￣)

### Current Status
The basic script is up and running! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶ But like any budding masterpiece, it needs some TLC, especially in the playback speed department. I'm working on it, so stay tuned! (✿◠‿◠)

### How You Can Help
Got any brilliant ideas to improve the sync between video and split audio? Don't be shy! Contribute or drop me a line. Let's make this translator awesome together! ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ

## Features (ﾉ´ヮ`)ﾉ*: ･ﾟ
- Translates videos to your desired language
- Uses freely available services (because who doesn't love free stuff?)
- Works with various video formats
- Preserves original sound effects and music

## Installation (⌐■_■)

### Note
You need python 3.11.9 to run this, thats the only python version I've tested that works with this script

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Felixdiamond/videoTranslator.git
   ```

2. Install the cool kids (I mean, dependencies):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd videoTranslator
   ```

2. Run the magic translator script:
   ```
   python translator.py <path_to_your_video> <target_language>
   ```

3. Grab a snack and wait for the translation magic to happen! ✨

4. Find your shiny new translated video in the root directory of the created folder.

## Known Issues (;´༎ຶД༎ຶ`)
- Playback speed needs some work (it's not perfect... yet!)
- Resource hungry (or maybe that's just because i'm using an 8gb ram pc with 512 HDD lol)
- Time consuming (again, maybe just my pc)
- May occasionally translate "hello" to "goodbye" (just kidding, but you never know with AI!)

## Future Plans (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
- Improve synchronization (because timing is everything in comedy and video translation)
- Add support for more languages (maybe even Klingon?)
- Make the UI so pretty, you'll want to frame it

## Contributing ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
Got ideas? Found a bug? Want to add Klingon support? Contributions are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

ありがとう for checking out my project! Let's make video translation great again! (oﾟvﾟ)ノ
